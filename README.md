## üåü Overview

The **Open-Source License Compliance Checker** is a comprehensive solution designed to help organizations maintain compliance with open-source license policies. This tool provides an intuitive way to analyze project dependencies and identify potential license conflicts before they become legal issues.

### üéØ Who Should Use This Tool?

| Role | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **üë®‚Äçüíª Developers** | Check license compatibility before committing code |
| **‚öñÔ∏è Legal Teams** | Enforce company-wide open-source policies |
| **üìä Project Managers** | Get clear overview of licenses used in projects |
| **üîç Compliance Officers** | Ensure adherence to organizational standards |

## ‚ú® Features

- **üìÅ Easy File Upload** - Drag & drop `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (Node.js) files
- **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Policies** - Define your own license policies with granular control
- **üé® Color-Coded Reports** - Instant visual feedback on compliance status
- **üîç Detailed Analysis** - Click any dependency for comprehensive license information
- **üìä Exportable Reports** - Download results as CSV for record-keeping
- **üöÄ Fast Processing** - Quick analysis with real-time results

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Modern web browser

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-compliance-checker.git
   cd license-compliance-checker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the tool**
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

### üê≥ Docker Deployment

For streamlined deployment and consistent environments, use Docker:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or run directly with Docker
docker build -t license-checker .
docker run -p 5000:5000 license-checker
```

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Docker ensures consistent behavior across different environments and eliminates dependency conflicts.

## üîß How It Works

The tool follows a simple three-step process:

   - Support for multiple file formats
   - Automatic file validation

2. **‚öôÔ∏è Define Your Policy**
   - Choose from predefined policies
   - Create custom license rules
   - Set risk thresholds

3. **üìä Get Detailed Report**
   - Instant compliance analysis
   - Color-coded results
